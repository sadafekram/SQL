# The Relational Model and Data Independence  

The relational model is the most used data model for databases because this model allows for data independence. Data is stored in a simple data structure.  

### Tables:  
This provides:  
- **Logical Data Independence**  
- **Physical Data Independence**  
- **Physical Storage Independence**

## "Chat GPT"  

I don't understand this part:  
> "This provides logical data independence, physical data independence, and physical storage independence."

What are **data independence, physical data independence, and physical storage independence**?  
How does a table provide them?  


## 1. Data Independence  
Data independence means that changes in one level of a database should not affect other levels. The relational model provides data independence because it separates how data is stored from how it is used.  

## 2. Logical Data Independence  
Logical data independence means that changes in the database schema (such as adding a new column to a table or modifying relationships between tables) **do not affect applications or queries that use the data**.  

For example, if you have a table `Employees(id, name, salary)` and later you add a new column `address`, existing queries that fetch `id, name, salary` will continue to work without modification.  

## 3. Physical Data Independence  
Physical data independence means that changes in how data is physically stored **do not affect the logical structure of the database**.  

For example, if the database moves from one type of storage (e.g., HDD to SSD) or changes indexing methods, the tables and their relationships remain the same for users and applications.  

## 4. Physical Storage Independence  
Physical storage independence goes even deeper, meaning that the way data is **internally stored on disk** (e.g., row-based vs. column-based storage, compression techniques, or distributed storage) **does not affect how the tables are designed or how users interact with them**.  


## How Tables Provide These Forms of Independence  

- **Tables separate logical data representation from physical storage.**  
  A table is a high-level abstraction that represents data in rows and columns without exposing how the data is actually stored on disk.  

- **Queries work at the logical level.**  
  You can write SQL queries without knowing how the database stores the data internally.  

- **Physical optimizations are invisible to users.**  
  The database engine can optimize storage (e.g., using indexes, partitioning, caching) without changing the table design.  

So, the relational model ensures that applications remain **unaffected** by changes in storage, schema, or indexing, making it easier to maintain and scale databases over time.

An entity relationship data model, or ER data model, is an alternative to a relational data model.

Using a simplified library database as an example, this figure shows an entity relationship diagram or ERD that represents entities called tables and their relationships. In the library example, we have books. A book can be written by one or many authors. The library can have one or many copies of a book. Each copy can be borrowed by only one borrower at a time.
